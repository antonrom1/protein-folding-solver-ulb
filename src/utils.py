    """
    Get the maximum score bound for a sequence of length n.
    The maximum score bound can only be reached if the sequence is all 1s and arranged as such:

    If one constructs a square (square 1) and then draws another square of identical size beside it (square 2),
    the squares share 1 edge. If one then places an identical square above square 2
    (instead of continuing in a straight path), there are now 2 shared edges.
    Continuing this pattern in an outward spiral, one finds that the number of shared edges is 4, 5, 7,

    For more information, see https://oeis.org/A000041.

    :return: the maximum score bound
